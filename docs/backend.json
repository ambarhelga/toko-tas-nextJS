    "reasoning": "The database structure is designed to store user information including email and name. Given the requirement for user authentication and personalized features like wishlists and order tracking, a user-centric structure is optimal. Each user has their own document under the `/users` collection, ensuring data isolation and simplified security rules based on user ID. This structure supports straightforward reads, writes, and updates to user-specific data.  This directly uses path-based ownership, which automatically guarantees authorization independence and avoids the need for denormalization or complex `get()` calls in the security rules.  Furthermore, QAPs are trivially satisfied as listing documents in `/users` is inherently protected via the user ID path segment and requires authentication."
